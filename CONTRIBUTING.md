# Contributing Guide

1. Make sure you put all links necessary! (read below)
2. Always add your items to the end of a list. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve.
3. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.



### Projects using Quasar

Since Quasar allows you to build for multiple platforms from the same code-base, please specify a link to each of the build modes (website, pwa, android, ios, electron).
If it's an opensource project, then also add a link to its github address.

Also please specify which Quasar version has been used for your product.

Example of addition:
```
| Name | [github](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar), [website](https://quasar.dev) | Description | v1.0.0 |
```

Please don't specify a website unless it is using Quasar.

#### Github link

Specifying a Github link gives the possibility for developers to contribute and be a part of an opensource project using their knowledge of Vue and Quasar.

You should put your Github link if the following conditions are true:
- The documentation (README) contains a description of the project, illustration of the project with a demo or screenshots and a CONTRIBUTING section.
- The project is active and maintained.
- The project accepts contributions.

The link provided should be the link of the github repository, not the demo.

#### Website/PWA link

Website/PWA links give the opportunity to showcase the awesome things we can build with Quasar.

You should put a website/PWA link if the following conditions are true:
- The website/PWA has been created with Quasar.
- The website/PWA is available without errors or ssl certificate problems, and load in a reasonable amount of time.
- The website/PWA is original and not too simple.

#### Mobile links

Mobile links (Android, iOS) give the opportunity to showcase the awesome mobile apps we can build with Quasar. The links themselves must point to your app's Google Play Store / Apple App Store page.

You should put a mobile link if the following conditions are true:
- The mobile app has been created with Quasar.
- The mobile app is original and not too simple.

#### Electron links

Electron links give the opportunity to showcase the awesome Electron apps we can build with Quasar. The links themselves must point to a website built specifically for your product. The website itself is not required to be written with Quasar too.

You should put an Electron link if the following conditions are true:
- The Electron app has been created with Quasar.
- The Electron app is original and not too simple.
